            <h2>Charles Ivan C. Lucas</h2>
                  <h2>IT Student</h2>
                 <p>By the way, I am Charles Ivan C. Lucas, a student
                   from Baliwag Polytechnic College taking Bachelor Science 
                   Information Technology and currently 2nd year college.
                    I took this course because I want to become a Full Stack Web Developer
                     in the future my passion is watching anime, listening to music, eating, 
                     riding a bike, spending time on social media, coding, and reading other people's code
                      . I'm a funny, interesting guy who enjoys having a good time. I have one quality that
                      It's crucial to understand, though, that although I initially come across as a very reserved individualistic guy
                      I am fantastic after I get to know folks and they feel at ease around me. For many people,
                      I find it difficult to make friends, but once I do, it's wonderful and we are all unique. I laugh, joke, and have fun.
                      Both the people and I benefit from what I contribute. I consider myself to be a very sensitive, caring, and kindhearted person.
                      Friends will let you know. I have a hard exterior, yet I'm gentle on the inside. I have strong moral principles as well.
                      and firmly rely on who is right and who is wrong. I also have a great sense of straightness and honesty. I recognize and
                      recognizing that sometimes we all put on a show and don't express how we truly feel or who we are, but some people do
                      I can't stand those types of people, and they do this all the time.</p>
